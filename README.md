# About Me

As of writing this, I am a 23 year old Communications and Networks engineering student. 

I have dreams of becoming a *full stack web developer*, so I'm planning on pushing code very frequently. Practice makes perfect after all.

My hobbies include writing, sketching, and rock climbing. (one of these is a lie)
